## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was to build out a simple but stylish blog preview card.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Vite
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass mixins
- Custom script to check accessibility (using [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y))

### What I learned
This challenge was mostly just a review and further practice of my skills. 

One new thing I learned while working on this was how to refine my 'a11y' script in package.json so that I could pass the name of the challenge as an argument, and it could thus be added dynamically to the output HTML file.
