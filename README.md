## My process

### Built with

- Vite (Vanilla JS)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass mixins

### What I learned
In this challenge, I was able to get some more practice (always a good thing!) writing semantic HTML, as well as using the BEM naming convention for CSS classes.

Additionally, I was able to solidify a strategy I intend to use, going forward, for creating a maintainable light-theme/dark-theme toggle.
